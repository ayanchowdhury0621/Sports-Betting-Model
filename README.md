Project Contributors: Ayan Chowdhury, Krishanu Datta, Christian Cattaneo

This project aims to create a model that allows for users to place more accurate bets for NFL football games. 

The lucrative world of sports betting is one of great volatility and unpredictability, especially for football. Those in the industry are responsible for carefully setting the lines for each game such that bettors are faced with difficult decisions on which teams to bet on each week. By finding the variables from past games that are most indicative in predicting the outcome and the covering of the spread of a game, one can strive to maximize profits from their bets. 

In this project, we aimed to identify these variables, such as ELO and QB differences as well as the impact of home-field advantage, to perform classification machine-learning tasks to calculate whether a team will cover the spread or not. These results were analyzed to determine whether our chosen variables were significant in their indication of the outcome of a football game.
